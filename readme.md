I just want to clarify that I am not a front-end engineer or a web developer and data visualization is also not my expertise. But I do really think it is an important part in interpreting data and would be very helpful for my statistic work in the future and also very useful for the medicine collaborations. I have been using R for a while and many R packages like ggplot are really helpful, but I have been always struggling and being bored with the templates restricted in R packages, so why not study some infrastructure development and design the layout by myself? D3.js and r2d3 is my initial stage but not the end.
